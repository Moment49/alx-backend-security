# 🛡️ IP Tracking in Django

IP tracking is a critical technique for enhancing security, understanding user behavior, and maintaining legal compliance in web applications. In Django, this can be implemented via **middleware**, **asynchronous tasks**, and integrations with external services. This module explores how to **log**, **blacklist**, **geolocate**, and **analyze** IP addresses responsibly and efficiently.

Learners will gain practical experience using Django tools and best practices to build **secure** and **privacy-conscious** IP tracking systems that scale.
